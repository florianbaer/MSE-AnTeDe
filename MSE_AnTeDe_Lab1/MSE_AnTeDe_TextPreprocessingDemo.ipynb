A new blaze near Goulburn, south-west of Sydney, has forced the closure of the Hume Highway. At about 4:00pm AEDT, a marked deterioration in the weather as a storm cell moved east across the Blue Mountains forced authorities to make a decision to evacuate people from homes in outlying streets at Hill Top in the New South Wales southern highlands. An estimated 500 residents have left their homes for nearby Mittagong. The New South Wales Rural Fire Service says the weather conditions which caused the fire to burn in a finger formation have now eased and about 60 fire units in and around Hill Top are optimistic of defending all properties. As more than 100 blazes burn on New Year's Eve in New South Wales, fire crews have been called to new fire at Gunning, south of Goulburn. While few details are available at this stage, fire authorities says it has closed the Hume Highway in both directions. Meanwhile, a new fire in Sydney's west is no longer threatening properties in the Cranebrook area. Rain has fallen in some parts of the Illawarra, Sydney, the Hunter Valley and the north coast. But the Bureau of Meteorology's Claire Richards says the rain has done little to ease any of the hundred fires still burning across the state. \"The falls have been quite isolated in those areas and generally the falls have been less than about five millimetres,\" she said. \"In some places really not significant at all, less than a millimetre, so there hasn't been much relief as far as rain is concerned. \"In fact, they've probably hampered the efforts of the firefighters more because of the wind gusts that are associated with those thunderstorms.\"  \n","\n","hundred people vacate home southern highland new south wale strong wind today huge bushfire towards town hill top new blaze near goulburn south-west sydney closure hume highway 4:00pm aedt marked deterioration weather storm cell east across blue mountain authority decision evacuate people home street hill top new south wale southern highland resident left home mittagong new south wale rural fire service weather condition fire burn finger formation fire unit around hill top optimistic property blaze burn new year eve new south wale fire crew new fire south goulburn detail available stage fire authority hume highway direction new fire sydney west longer property cranebrook area rain part illawarra sydney hunter valley north coast bureau meteorology claire richards rain little ease fire burning across state fall isolated area fall five millimetre place significant millimetre much relief rain concerned fact effort firefighter wind gust thunderstorm\n"]}],"source":["print(data_df['text'].iloc[0], '\\n')\n","print(data_df['processed'].iloc[0])"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"y_P8pr8iF0cH"},"source":["## 3.
